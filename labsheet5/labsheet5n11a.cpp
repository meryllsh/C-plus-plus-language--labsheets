//A person currently has an amount P of money, in a bank, which pays an annual interest rate of r%.
//Write a program that allows the input of values for P, r as well as n, where n represents the
//number of years for which the money has remained in the bank. The program must calculate and
//display the total amount in the personâ€™s account at the end of each year for the n years. Display
//the results in an appropriate format.
//Note that this problem involves the calculation of compound interest.
