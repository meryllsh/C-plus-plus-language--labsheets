//A speeding ticket fine policy is Rs 500 plus Rs 10 for each km/hr over the speed limit of
//90 km/hr.
//Write a program that accepts speed in km/hr as input, and displays a message indicating
//that the speed limit has not been exceeded or prints the amount of the fine that has to
//be paid. Also, speed should be in the range of 0 â€“ 300 km/hr. All speeds outside this
//range should be rejected as invalid and a suitable message is to be displayed.
